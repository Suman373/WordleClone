## About
This is wordle-like game made using API and vanilla Javascript(es6). Although fully responsive in mobile phones,desktop is recommended for better experience. The rules are simple:

- You are given 6 chances
- You need to guess the 5 lettered word
- If letter exists in the word, it will show yellow tile, if not grey and if it is at its correct position, it will be colored green.
- The key colors are also changed to make it easier for the player/user to keep a track
- If you cant't guess, the word is shown but the best thing? You can play again! Oh yeah! &#10034;
